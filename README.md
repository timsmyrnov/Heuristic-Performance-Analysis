# Trading Strategy Evaluation Framework

This project is aimed at substantiating the hypothesis that random trading often outperforms heuristic strategies. This is done by creating a so-called trading monkey which randomly operates a portfolio under the same conditions as the user. It generates a series of trades and determines if its strategy was more effective than the user's.

## Usage

### Quick Start

For quick start, run `launch.py` and input "sample_trading_history.csv" when prompted to enter file name. Then, follow the directions â€” the process is fairly intuitive.

### Custom Trade History

For custom settings, stick to the following process:

1. Export `.csv` file from any exchange and format it accordingly
2. Import the file inside the root folder
3. Run `launch.py` and follow instructions

Done!

### Constraints & Formatting

Custom trading history **must** be of `.csv` format and contain the following columns:

- `Date`
- `Ticker`
- `Price`
- `Quantity`
- `Trans Code`
